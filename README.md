# Auto Text Replace

This is a simple plugin that allows you to define a set of text replacements that will be made dynamically as you type

Some example usages
- Replace abbrevations with full words
- Add emojis to use as icons
  - For example, you can define a replacement that swaps in `⚠️` when you type `-warn-`
- Replace a double en dash with a single em dash
